Welcome to the Defense Unicorns Hiring Repository.  Contained here you will find the technical and non-technical exercises we use to evaluate future Unicorns for their roles.

Defense Unicorns provide secure, open source and infrastructure agnostic applications and tools that enable our partners to rapidly accelerate their software acquisition and delivery processes. Our open source applications enable DevSecOps on even the most secure systems.

We are innovators, software engineers, and veterans with decades of experience delivering technology programs across the DoD as well as the broader federal market. Our team of unicorns are zany and passionate individuals who are dedicated to mission success.

Defense Unicorns operates with a single belief; that a value not lived is not a value at all. Our team exercises habits every day that bring our values to life.
